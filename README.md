# European_Country_Guessing_Game
I have made a european country guessing game in which a program generated country is being matched with the user's input country. The program first randomly generates a number and using that number from an Array of European countries the program generated country is selected. The user then input his/her guess if the correct is right the country data is fetched from a public API using promises and its flag is being showed and if user inputs a wrong country then his score will get reduced by one point on every wrong guess. 

The Fun part is there is als a hint option, which user can use to see the first letter of the program generated country.
